This repository contains the assignments completed for the **Web Technologies 1** FEI STU.

## Assignments Overview

### Zadanie_1: Website About Yourself Using Pure HTML and CSS 
This is a simple website created using only **HTML** and **CSS**, where the goal was to showcase personal
information and style the content without using any JavaScript or advanced CSS frameworks. 

### Zadanie_2: Website with a Form for Practicing JavaScript
This website contains a form designed to practice **JavaScript**. It allows users to input data and interact
with the page using basic JavaScript functionality, demonstrating skills in DOM manipulation and form validation. 

### Zadanie_3: Website with Charts Using Chart.js Library & Bootstrap
For this assignment, I used the Chart.js library to create dynamic and interactive charts. The task was
to practice working with JSON data and using a third-party JavaScript library to visualize the data in a user-friendly way.
Additionally, I used Bootstrap to improve the layout and responsive design.
